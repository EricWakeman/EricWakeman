# Hello! I'm Eric Wakeman.

I am currently a student at BoiseCodeWorks, learning full stack development. Iâ€™m having a great time with the challenge of learning a new skill and set of knowledge. I come from a background of public service, animal welfare, and law enforcement. My previous work as an Animal Care and Control Officer taught me a lot of useful skills and gave me the ability to think in a dynamic manner and always be prepared to change and adapt.


My interests outside of coding include music, video games, theatre, and zoology.
