# Hello! I'm Eric Wakeman.

I am a Data Engineer and Software Developer and an alumnus of CodeWorks. My strengths are  in Data management and ETL development. I also am comfortable in many software languages including C#, JavaScript, Python, all varieties of SQL, and more. I come from a background of public service, animal welfare, and law enforcement. My previous work as an Animal Care and Control Officer taught me a lot of useful skills and gave me the ability to think in a dynamic manner and always be prepared to change and adapt.


My interests outside of coding include music, video games, theatre, and zoology.
