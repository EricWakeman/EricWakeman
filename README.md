# Hello! I'm Eric Wakeman.

I am a Full-Stack developer and an alumnus of CodeWorks. My comfortzone is in HTML/CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, SQL, and C#. I am learning Java, and Python. I am also experienced with the Vue.js framework, and other ORMs and data platforms including, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDb, Dapper, and MySQL. I come from a background of public service, animal welfare, and law enforcement. My previous work as an Animal Care and Control Officer taught me a lot of useful skills and gave me the ability to think in a dynamic manner and always be prepared to change and adapt.


My interests outside of coding include music, video games, theatre, and zoology.
